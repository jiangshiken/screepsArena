#Predict Sys
	test predict pos
	SDF short distance fight
		use all to closest en as default case
		multiple predict path(use trig)
			do micro changes as a case cover the default case
			the movement/attack of friend/enemy will trig other changes
		judge if is the same case
		enemyPosPredict(only cal melee)
			enemyVelocity
			enemy may adjacent to friend
		every one step movement of friend
		calculate the earning_damage of a case in a single tick

#目前通用本最大的问题/BUG
	容易超时
	攻击爬老是喜欢打对面的rampart
	农民丢container和运能量到ext看情况实施
	逃跑（flee）时经常会选择有敌人的路线
	攻击爬攻击spawn时总是莫名其妙乱晃

        builder stay at spawn x-3/+3 when tick71
        rampart cs come with builder at same time
        when spawn is full ,harvester will wait at base with CM body and full energy
        builder is always 140 energy when building
#force map sum force use combine decrease
    a=a.force,b=b.force
