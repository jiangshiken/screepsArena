            the action should not be used directly ,but

#moverLogic
	mover weight
		distance to startPos
        pull fatigue
            weight=force/need fatigue
#general logic
	use the this tick action to gene all new
	maps .by the current action list
	predict enemy move and attack
	update all predict maps.that is in short
	time tick,like +1,+2..or in specific tick
	like 1500,1800.
    use the feedback to decide the action of this tick.
